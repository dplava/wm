<dcterms:description>Thanks Maurice for his help; informs Maurice that his baggage has already been shipped to Le Havre; if Captain Calizt's ship was going to Virginia instead of Philadelphia he would have taken it, but the overland trip would have been too difficult for his family; he will go with Captain Calizt immediately if Calizt will drop him off in Hampton or Norfolk; if Calizt agrees, Jefferson wants Maurice to inform him that Jefferson needs three "masters births [berths]" for himself and his two daughters and berths for two servants, one man and one woman; wants Maurice to inform him of Calizt's answer about letting the Jeffersons off in Virginia and the price of the voyage as soon as possible; if it works out, Jefferson will be in L'Orient on October 4th; thanks Maurice for his help.</dcterms:description>
