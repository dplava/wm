<dcterms:description>Price of lands should be lowered so a larger group of citizens could purchase them; would also induce industrious foreigners to come; suggests purchase of East and West Florida; perhaps Messrs [James] Monroe and [Charles] Pinckney are already so instructed; at close of War a Land Office was opened in this state for exchange of officers' and soldiers' certificates for land in Tennessee; his father-in-law, Col. Wade, took 3,000 acres on north side of Tennessee river; it proved to be in Indian territory; hopes Congress will take some action; refers him to Archibald Henderson and W.B. Gro[ves] for references; can say nothing in favor of their member [of Congress: Duncan McFarlane]; not elected by majority of votes, but by an error in the conduct of electors.</dcterms:description>
