<dcterms:description>The Jeffersons' journey from "Hoor du monde" [Hors-du-Monde, in Cumberland County, VA] was easy; divided the remainder of the trip into two days at Mrs. Carr's; found the "Byrd ordinary" a "wretched place indeed" but did not want to lie in the woods; met Jefferson's wagons at the stone quarry where he left Skipwith's horses; suggests Skipwith change his route because the road is so rutted by wagons; does not believe Skipwith can make it to Monticello from the Byrd house in a day; has spoken to John Nicholas, Jr.  who says his father awaits Skipwith's arrival; there should be no problems because Nicholas' father keeps a boat on the James and Slate rivers; Nicholas told his father to expect Skipwith on January 29; Jefferson's horses will meet Skipwith the following day where Jefferson's road leaves the main road; regards to Mrs. Anne Wayles Skipwith and the children.</dcterms:description>
