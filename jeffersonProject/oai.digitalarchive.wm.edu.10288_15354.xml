<dcterms:description>Approves of Short's decision to spend the winter in Washington, D.C. rather than Philadelphia; explains that Short will learn a great deal about the workings of the government by living in Washington, D.C.; suggests that Short can find a house along "the avenue" to the Capitol or near the Treasury where General Dearborne and Mr. and Mrs. Cutts board; the affairs with Spain put on hold until Napoleon Bonaparte returned to Paris; with Napoleon's return he agreed to the United States' terms; Jefferson waits to see if it was "in good faith" or not; the state of affairs with Great Britain is uncertain; possibility of maritime war with Great Britain; necessity of foreign loans if the United States goes to war with Great Britain; Short's services in obtaining these loans will most likely be needed; classification of the militia; expresses his affection for General Moreau; still has not found anyone capable of running Short's estate, but Price will have to do.</dcterms:description>
