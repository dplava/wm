<dcterms:description>Saw his friend Col. John Stuart in Greenbrier Co. with intention to visit cave where bones of American Lion were found; found he had already been there and sent Jefferson bones; describes some others that were found and gives account of George Wilson and John Davies's report of their experience while hunting on Cheet River in 1765; also similar account by a John Moorehead; mentions animal figures carved on rock by natives many years ago on bank of Kanhawa; does not believe bones found can be of animal heard on 1765 as found some distance underground; Mr. Cavendish feels they are of great antiquity; some of best deer licks in Greenbrier formerly frequented by buffalo are continuious to cave where bones were found; Mr. Randolph had memo from Jefferson to enquire where V. Miller could do some work for him in September but has more work on hand than can be completed in that time; the executive has requested his attention to running boundary line between Virginia and Kentucky; finds he does not have act of separation and requests Jefferson's copy; Mr. Monroe will bring it to the district court.</dcterms:description>
