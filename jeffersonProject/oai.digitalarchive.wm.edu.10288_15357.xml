<dcterms:description>Has read a letter by Mrs. Colden about the education of Alexander Colden, her son, and is very pleased with her decisions; suggests that there is no better school for science than the University of Edinburgh; the Universities of England and America rank after Edinburgh in science, but the school in America is more "exact in their morals, and give firmer habits of application" than the schools in England; comments on the importance of learning French, particularly through conversation but suggests that young American men should be sent to Canada to learn French rather than France where their "morals, health and fortune are more irresistably endangered than in any country of the universe"; manners are another important subject of education; learning manners in France is good for one who plans to travel throughout Europe, but it is best for one to learn the manners of one's own country; requests that Stewart tell Mrs. Colden that if she sends her son to France Jefferson will assist him any way he can; sends an issue of The Repository from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.</dcterms:description>
